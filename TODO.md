# TODO

- [ ] Add example `config.example.disp` to repository
- [ ] Add user `XDG_USER_CONFIG` directory as a default configuration path
- [ ] Implement ordering capabilities on rules, or at least make it so the last define rule is the default one
- [ ] Make an interactive layout selector based on configured hashes
- [ ] Add pre and post layout set script execution (to update wallpaper for example)
- [ ] Gracefully error handling on executable run (add condition catch with general error print)
